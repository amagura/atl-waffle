  - Wrote the implementation of `concat', which he subsequently released into the Public Domain.
  I came across it while trying to find a viable alternative to a `concat' implementation found in the
  GNU C manual, which I was uncomfortable using since it is licensed under the GNU FDL, which AFAIK
  could mean that using it in a non-GPL'd piece of software might be in violation of its license.
  So I was only too pleased when I came across Alexander Peslyak's code and realized that it was Public Domain.

  The version that I used as the basis for Commoner's concat family of functions, albeit slightly
  different (if at all), can be found here:
